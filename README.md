# Shaji_arrayProblems
This program contains methods that take in an arraylist and manipulates the array or derives information from the elements of the array.   I chose to create random elements to populate the array with numbers ranging from 1 to 12. Look at this array as results of someone  rolling 2 dice. The programs takes a randomly generated array list and manipulates it accordingly. This program deals with arraylists containing integers only.
